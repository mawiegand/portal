      box1:
        title: Wack-a-what?!
        body: |-
          Wack-a-Doo is a MMO strategy game in which you take care of a tribe of wacky cavemen. 
          Help them prosper, by fighting or making friends with other tribes - it's your decision. 
          Soon, you'll be able to enter their persistent world anytime and anywhere, 
          using a browser, an iPhone or iPad.
          
      box2:
        title: So, what's different?
        body: |-
          Unlike other MMO strategy games, our units are actually visible
          on the world map, and don't just teleport around invisibly. Feels
          much more 
          like a classic board game, really. You're playing with thousands of people,
          the community is at the center of the game. And: We have dinosaurs! 
          Can't beat dinosaurs.
          
      box3:
        title: What do I do, then?
          
      box4:
        title: Great! Let me see the game!

      box5:
        title: How much does it cost?
        body: |-
          You can play for the great price of <b>free</b>. 
          To make this clear: playing Wack-a-Doo was free of charge, is free 
          of charge and will be free of charge; it costs nothing, nada, zero.</p>
          <p>However, we, too, have
          to feed our dinosaurs somehow. That's why there's an optional premium account 
          offering comfort features and why you'll also have the
          opportunity to give us small amounts of money and benefit from
          convenience features, time-savers and small boosts. We are
          however firm believers that multiplayer games should always be
          balanced and should never turn into auctions.

      box6:
        title: Armies on the world map
        body: |-
            Armies are always visible on the world map. No more giving orders
            through interfaces that look like spreadsheets! They actually
            exist on the world map, too, so they can't just teleport through
            enemy territory like they do in other games in this genre. This
            adds a new strategic gameplay dimension, because for the first
            time, location affects more than just travel time. So it's more
            like board games and RTS games.

      box7:
        title: True cross-platform
        body: |-
              Whack-a-doo is being developed as a true cross-platform game
              from the very beginning. Starting now, command your
              tribe from your browser.  Our modern HTML5 client does not
              require any plugins, no flash, no nothing. In the near future
              you'll be able to access the world from anywhere at any time.
              Whether you're using a desktop computer, notebook or smartphone;
              everybody accesses and plays in the same virtual world.
              </p>
              <p>Furthermore, starting this winter,
               we will offer native clients for the iOS platform.
              We take extra 
              care that each platform's
              interface is specifically tailored to its individual properties. 
              We'll adapt the gameplay carefully to every single
              platform, so that it'll always feel just right to you.

      box8:
        title: What do I need to play?
        body: |-
            The current release of Whack-a-doo it as a html5 browser game
            (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). A native iOS
            Client is next.

      box9:
        title: Who are you guys, anyway?
        body: |-
              We're avid fans of the genre and some of us were heavily
              involved in one of its first games in Germany, 
              <a href="http://www.uga-agga.com">Uga-Agga</a>, 
              which even today,
              after more than 10 years, still has a loyal, active fanbase. 
              Now <a href="http://www.5dlab.com">we rejoined</a>   in order to take it one step further.
              </p>
              <p> We're a small team based in Freiburg, Germany, but we're already planning a bunch of
              revolutionary innovations to the genre. Leveraging the armies
              to be visible on the world map is just the very first step. Stay put!
