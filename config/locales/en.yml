      teaser: Wanna know more about the game?
      
      
    about:
      box1:
        title: Wack-a-what?!
        body: |-
          Wack-a-doo is a MMO strategy game in which you take care of a tribe of wacky cavemen. 
          Help them prosper and grow and lead them into battle or make friends with other tribes. 
          You will be able to enter their persistent world anytime and anywhere, using a browser, an iPhone or iPad.
          
      box2:
        title: So, what's different?
        body: |-
          Unlike other MMO strategy games, our units are actually visible
          on the world map, and don't just teleport around invisibly. More
          like a board game, really. Whack-a-doo is being developed as a
          true cross-platform game from the start. There will be no lousy
          platform-inappropriate interfaces! And: We have dinosaurs! Can't beat
          dinosaurs.
          
      box3:
        title: What do I do, then?
          
      box4:
        title: Great! Let me see the game!

      box5:
        title: How much does it cost?
        body: |-
          You can play for the great price of <b>free</b>. 
          To make this clear: playing wack-a-doo was free of charge, is free 
          of charge and will be free of charge; it costs nothing, nada, zero.</p>
          <p>However, we, too, have
          to feed our dinosaurs somehow. That's the why there's an optional premium account 
          offering comfort features and why you'll also have the
          opportunity to give us small amounts of money and benefit from
          convenience features, time-savers and small boosts. We are
          however firm believers that multiplayer games should always be
          balanced and should never turn into auctions.

      box6:
        title: Armies on the world map
        body: |-
            Armies are always visible on the world map. No more giving orders
            through interfaces that look like spreadsheets! They actually
            exist on the world map, too, so they can't just teleport through
            enemy territory like they do in other games in this genre. This
            adds a new strategic gameplay dimension, because for the first
            time, location affects more than just travel time. So it's more
            like board games and RTS games.

      box7:
        title: True cross-platform
        body: |-
              Whack-a-doo is being developed as a true cross-platform game
              from the very beginning. Command your
              tribe from any device anywhere using the HTML5 client. No plugins necessary! 
              </p>
              <p>Furthermore, we will offer native clients for a number of platforms.
              We take extra 
              care that each platform's
              interface is specifically tailored to its individual properties, 
              so that it'll always feel just right.

      box8:
        title: What do I need to play?
        body: |-
            The current release of Whack-a-doo it as a html5 browser game
            (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). A native iOS
            Client is next.

      box9:
        title: Who are you guys, anyway?
        body: |-
              We're avid fans of the genre and some of us were heavily
              involved in one of its first games, Uga-Agga, which even today,
              after many, many years, still has a loyal, active fanbase. Now
              we want to take it one step further and already have a bunch of
              revolutionary innovations planned that we will announce soon.
              Stay put!
