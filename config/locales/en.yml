      box1:
        title: Wack-a-what?!
        body: |-
          Wack-a-Doo is a MMO strategy game in which you take care of a tribe of wacky cavemen. 
          Help them prosper, by fighting or making friends with other tribes - it's your decision. 
          Soon, you'll be able to enter their persistent world anytime and anywhere, 
          using a browser, an iPhone or iPad.
          
      box2:
        title: So, what's different?
        body: |-
          Unlike other MMO strategy games, our units are actually visible
          on the world map, and don't just teleport around invisibly. Feels
          much more 
          like a classic board game, really. You're playing with thousands of people,
          the community is at the center of the game. And: We have dinosaurs! 
          Can't beat dinosaurs.
          
      box3:
        title: What do I do, then?
          
      box4:
        title: Great! Let me see the game!

      box5:
        title: How much does it cost?
        body: |-
          You can play for free. To make this clear: playing Wack-a-Doo was free of charge, is free
          of charge and always will be free of charge; it costs nothing, nada, zero.</p>
          <p>However, we have to feed our dinosaurs somehow, too. That's why there's an optional
          platinum account offering comfort features. You also have the opportunity
          to pay small amounts of money and benefit from convenient features, time
          saving and small boosts. However, we truly believe that multiplayer games
          should always be balanced and never turn into auctions.


      more_details: "Yeah, alright, I still wanna know more details..."

      box6:
        title: Armies on the world map
        body: |-
            Armies are always visible on the world map. No more giving orders
            through interfaces that look like spreadsheets! They actually
            exist on the world map, too, so they can't just teleport through
            enemy territory like they do in other games in this genre. This
            adds a new strategic gameplay dimension, because for the first
            time, location affects more than just travel time. So it's more
            like board games and RTS games.

      box7:
        title: True cross-platform
        body: |-
              We are developing Wack-A-Doo as a true cross-platform game right
              from the very beginning. You can command your tribe from your
              browser: Our modern HTML5 client does not require any plugins,
              no flash, no nothing. You are are also able to access the game
              from anywhere at any time. Whether you use a desktop computer,
              a notebook or an iPhone - everybody accesses and plays in the
              same virtual world.</p>
              <p>We offer you a native client for the iOS platform. We take
              extra care of each platform so it has the right look and feel
              for its individual properties. We adapt the gameplay carefully
              to every single platform, so it'll feel just right to you.
      box8:
        title: Taxes and Areas of Control
        body: |-
          Have you ever dreamed of taxing your boss? In Wack-A-Doo this dream
          comes true!</p><p>In Wack-A-Doo squares can be conquered and possessed
          like in a board game. This allows you to control access to all
          settlements residing inside your square ('region') and to 
          tax their owners. You can conquer and hold large areas of the map
          together with your allies, found a realm and see its outer borders
          on the map. With your empire being large enough, you win the round.  
                    
      box9:
        title: Who are you guys, anyway?
        body: |-
              We're avid fans of the genre and some of us were heavily
              involved in one of its first games in Germany,
              <a href="http://www.uga-agga.com">Uga-Agga</a>,
              which even today,
              after more than 10 years, still has a loyal, active fanbase.
              Now <a href="http://www.5dlab.com">we rejoined</a>   in order to take it one step further.
              </p>
              <p> We're a small team based in Freiburg, Germany, but we're already planning a bunch of
              revolutionary innovations to the genre. Leveraging the armies
              to be visible on the world map is just the very first step. Stay put!
      box10:
        title: How can I play along?
        body: |-
              You can start playing right away. You can log in right here
              with your e-mail address or you download our app for iPhone,
              iPad and iPod touch. The registration is safe and without any
              hidden costs: You won't end up buying a washing machine or a
              subscription - no risks, all fun! If you don't like the game,
              don't sweat it, you don't have to do a thing. Your account
              will be deleted automatically if you haven't been active for a
              longer time.</p>
              <p>We support every current browser: Reasonably updated
              versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer (version 9)
              work. It also runs very smoothly with Opera Next. We recommend
              to use a desktop computer and a browser while working or during your
              lunch break ;-) for the full availability of all functions, including
              chat. After several tests at our lab we can recommend to use your iPad
              or laptop with browser for several more laid back locations: Kick back
              on your couch or your bed, play the app in boring lectures and of course
              on the loo. Waiting for the morning commute? iPhone App!
      box11:
        title: Amazing Community
        body: |-
              Wack-A-Doo encloses a small but nice community that has been
              growing for the past 10 years. The atmosphere in the chat and
              the forum are friendly, even beyond enemy lines - quite untypical
              for the Stone Age! You can enter the "global" chat without armor.
              Many gamers are very helpful and cooperative. There might be a short
              primal scream after defeat, but everyone is a sport and has a good laugh
              afterwards. Of course we also have some trolls lurking around, but they
              are easy to spot and are a great target for a joint truncheon attack.
      box12:
        title: Regular Content Updates and Improvements
        body: |-
              Wack-A-Doo is being permanently developed and receives new game
              content all the time. So you participate in a constantly growing
              game that will always come up with something new and won't get
              boring for months. Right now we are planing to introduce adventures
              and heroes (and heroines): Take on their role and move through the
              game world yourself.</p>
              <p>And the best of it is: You can take immediate part in the development.
              You can meet the developers of Wack-A-Doo in the game and in the chat
              where they are in contact with the gamers at all times.
              
      beta2:
        title: What are you working on right now?
        body: |-
              Perhaps you were already wondering, why there hasn't been many 
              public updates and new features during the last months. The reason
              is us being working on a completely new version for iOS, Android,
              Browser and Facebook. Please find two screenshots from the soon to
              be published new version below.
